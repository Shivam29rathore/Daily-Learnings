/etc/resolv.conf. The /etc/resolv.conf is resolver configuration file for Linux and UNIX like operating systems. It is used to configure dns name servers. The file /etc/resolv.conf file contains information that is read by the resolver routines the first time they are invoked by a process.


A name server is a computer application that implements a network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service. It translates an often humanly meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This service is performed by the server in response to a service protocol request.

b) Insatlling Confluent in Linux :(Manual)

https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/installing_cp/zip-tar.html





(03/08/19)




1) Insatlling Confluent for Development environment:

By commands in terminal :



https://docs.confluent.io/3.3.0/installation/installing_cp.html 



For quick start:


https://docs.confluent.io/3.3.0/quickstart.html#quickstart



2) Error :


|Zookeeper failed to start
zookeeper is [DOWN]
Cannot start Kafka, Zookeeper is not running. Check your deployment



Solution:


a) Reason:
Informs you that zookeeper is down, is that there's another zookeeper instance that is currently running, and the new zookeeper instance can not bind to its required port (by default this port is 2181).

Solution :
Kill the already running java or zookeeper processes,and might be the java Path is not saved in bashrc file .

2) KSQL SERVER START:

https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/installation/server-config/index.html



Command to start KSQL CLI Mode:


$ LOG_DIR=./ksql_logs <path-to-confluent>/bin/ksql http://localhost:8088




3) If we download the Confluent via Zip file, then only we get the packages as 


: /bin
:/etc
:/share



In othercases like tar and from repository it is like:



:/lib
:/share
:/src


But instructions for KSQL SERVER START ARE AVAILABLE FOR ZIP FORMAT ONLY IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION.






4) NOTE:


The concept of Confluent CLI ie Command Line Interface is nothing but in single command it starts the desired service.
And we have to install it separately apart from  Confluent platform itself.


a) 
Run this script to install the Confluent CLI. This command creates a bin directory in your designated location (<path-to-directory>/bin). The location must be in your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin).

curl -L https://cnfl.io/cli | sh -s -- -b /<path-to-directory>/bin : For Independent download : Actually The Confluent CLI is included as a part of the Confluent Platform package after 3.3 version .To install, download the Confluent Platform package.


b) We just have to set the path of Confluent CLI before using it in case of Installation through zip file format .



6) KSQL Streams Developer Guide:


https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/index.htmlz





(05/08/19)


1) Trying to solve the intsallation problem:



Note:


In case of Confluent installation through zip file , it doesn't contain the Confluent CLI , we have to install manually .(In case of communinty install)


`
2) KSQL CLI does not connect to KSQL server:


https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/troubleshoot-ksql.html



3) To get the Id of a running Process:


pgrep -f zookeeper



4) Note :

When installing through the weget method : 
we can use the confluent command instantly and it will work .




5) Entering root in Ubuntu :



As in case of Confluent installation from apt package so the confluent is inside the user/bin directory which is accessed by root only.
so we have to become root user then only we can go to the confluent file directory and then inturn go to the ksql-server.properties so that we can get started the KSQL server.

For being root:


a)Just enter su - then press enter .

b) Enter password then you are root.




6) su: Authentication failure  :ERROR


Solution:


a) Activate the root user in Linux :



1)sudo passwd root
2) type user password then create the root password.



(06/08/19)


1) Unable to find the confluent directory:

Solution

2) What is a deb file?

A file with the DEB file extension is a Debian Software Package file. They're used mainly in Unix-based operating systems, including Ubuntu and iOS. Every DEB file consists of two TAR archives that make up the executable files, documentation, and libraries





(09/08/19)


1)Completely uninstall Confluent from Ubuntu :



a) sudo apt-get remove confluent-platform-oss-2.11

b)sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.confluent.io/deb/3.3 stable main"

c) sudo apt autoremove   (For removal of remaining dependencies)
     

    or

a) rm -rf confluent-5.3.0

b) rm -rf /var/lib/<confluent-platform-data-files>






2) Manual Installation of Confluent:


https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/installing_cp/zip-tar.html#prod-kafka-cli-install


Procedure :

Configure the each component of Confluent manually by going inside the <path to confluent > etc/x.properties

(17/08/19)



1)Where does the apt package manager stores the installed packages:



dpkg -L <packagename>





2) Removing Confluent platform and trying to download it via .tar file :

But now as there is no confluent CLI there we have to define it in environment variables :


confluent: command not found



a) Installation for development:


https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/ce-quickstart.html#ce-quickstart



(i) For production ready environment:

2) Adding an existing Project on Github!


Steps :


1) Remove all git related files from project : Go inside project directory and then by command : rm -rf .git
 and also : git clone <repo https://....>
2) git init 

3) git add .

4) git commit -m 'message'

5)Now add the origin repository 

:

git remote add origin https://........

6) git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

7) git push -u origin master





3) Error :  Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind

4) Error: fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories


Solution:
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories



.......



(06/09/19)




1)Reattempt to set up Confluent on local:



Change in approach : Try to download confluent and use as it is and then use KSQL properly for streaming :


STEPS:



1)  wget -qO - https://packages.confluent.io/deb/3.3/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -

2)  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.confluent.io/deb/3.3 stable main"

3) sudo apt-get update

4) Confluent open source:

sudo apt-get install confluent-platform-oss-2.11


5) As confluent is bundled with confluent CLI so just type :


  confluent start and all the components like zookeeper,kafka ,kafka-connect will start automatically 






2) Starting KSQL server and then start Data streaming in KSQL:


a) First we have to configure the KSQL server:


https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/installation/server-config/index.html#ksql-server-configs






(07/09/19)




1) Confluent installation through tar file:

a) Download confluent through zip or tar file: It doesn't have the Confluent CLI so we have to install it separately so its better to use it via apt package manager and there is actually the problem of  the path  creating the issue of confluent command not found in case of installation through Zip file format.Now solved.


NOTE:
The Confluent CLI is included as a part of the Confluent Platform package. To install, download the Confluent Platform package.




2) While using Confluent CLI through we have to configure it first :


https://docs.confluent.io/3.3.0/cli/installing.html


/home/shivam/Downloads/confluent-5.3.0






(08/09/19)

solution:

sum(iterable, start)
The sum() function adds start and elements of the given iterators from left to right.

The iterable may be Python list, tuple, set, or dictionary.




2) Join method in Python:

The join() method provides a flexible way to concatenate string. It concatenates each element of an iterable (such as list, string and tuple) to the string and returns the concatenated string.

The syntax of join() is:

string.join(iterable)



3) abs method in Python:

The abs() takes only one argument, a number whose absolute value is to be returned. The argument can be an integer, a floating point number or a complex number. If the argument is an integer or floating point number, abs() returns the absolute value in integer or float.

1) Framework vs API:

A framework is a type of software library that provides generic functionality which can be extended by the programmer to build applications. Flask and Django are good examples of frameworks intended for web development.

A framework is distinguished from a simple library or API. An API is a piece of software that a developer can use in his or her application. A framework is more encompassing: your entire application is structured around the framework (i.e. it provides the framework around which you build your software). 



2) Generator Comprehension:

A generator comprehension is a single-line specification for defining a generator in Python. It is absolutely essential to learn this syntax in order to write simple generator.

Raw strings are raw string literals that treat backslash (\) as a literal character. For example, if we try to print a string with a “\n” inside, it will add one line break. But if we mark it as a raw string, it will simply print out the “\n” as a normal character.




2) CARET SYMBOL:

 A caret is another name for a cursor. 2. Alternatively referred to as the circumflex, the caret is the symbol ( ^ ) above the 6 key on a standard United States qwerty keyboard. In mathematics, the caret represents an exponent, such as a square, cube, or another exponential power

(18/04/2020)




1) Shared Preference or using INternal storage in Anrdroid:

(We use the Shared Preference Interface for this purpose:)



2) Class VS Interface:


A class is a blueprint from which we can create objects that share the same configuration - properties and methods. An interface is a group of related properties and methods that describe an object, but neither provides implementation nor initialisation for them.



3) Vector Asset VS Image Asset:


According to Android User Guide : Image Asset Studio helps you create various types of icons at different densities and shows you exactly where they'll be placed in your project. ... Vector Asset Studio adds a vector graphic to the project as an XML file that describes the image.




4) How to display background image in text view?


Solution:

Simply add this in the textfile either by drag and drop or in Layout.xml file or in JAVA file:


android:background="@drawable/myResouce"



5) Making TextView scrollable on Android:


Solution:


Just set the

android:scrollbars = "vertical"
properties of your TextView in your layout's xml file.

Then use:

yourTextView.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod());

in your code.




6) Set up background image in Layout:

android:background="@drawable/icon"




7) dp vs sp in Margin and Padding:


sp for font sizes, dp for everything else. sp stands for Scale-independent Pixels, dp stands for dip=density independent pixels.




8) Getting EditText data to TextView simultaneously:


  Tv=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.tv);
    Et=(EditText)findViewById(R.id.et);


    final Handler handler=new Handler();
    handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {

            Tv.setText(Et.getText().toString());
        handler.postDelayed(this,100);
        }
    },100);



9) SQLite DataBase:


SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database. It is embedded in android bydefault. So, there is no need to perform any database setup or administration task.



10) Format all Shortcut in Android studio:


Android Studio takes care of all the formatting. Just Press CTRL+ALT+L on Windows or Command+Option+L on Mac. The android studio will reformat all the code for you.




11) trying to draw too large(119669760bytes) bitmap.:


Solution : This happens in low resolution devices like simulators , but It may not happen in Real phone, 

while one of the solutions may be shifting the Images from res/drwable to res/drawble-xxhdpi/ folder.






(19/04/2020)



1) Constructor in Java:


Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it's not a method as it doesn't have a return type. ... Constructor has same name as the class and looks like this in a java code.




2) Error:Failed to choose config with EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR_PRESERVED, retrying without..:

Solution :
 This is just a warning !



3) Log not visible to in the LOGCAT:

 
Whenever we want to see the logs then simply have no filter in side , simply write the Tag.




4)  onCreate method in  MydbHandler class is not working ?


The reason could be that, the database is already created , so wont be  created again!

1)  Deleting the contacts?


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neaCUaHa2Ek



2) Recyler View Android:


If your app needs to display a scrolling list of elements based on large data sets (or data that frequently changes), you should use RecyclerView as described on this page.


The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.

In the RecyclerView model, several different components work together to display your data. The overall container for your user interface is a RecyclerView object that you add to your layout. The RecyclerView fills itself with views provided by a layout manager that you provide. You can use one of our standard layout managers (such as LinearLayoutManager or GridLayoutManager), or implement your own.






(21/04/2020)

  
1)  Card View in Android:

Apps often need to display data in similarly styled containers. These containers are often used in lists to hold each item's information. The system provides the CardView API as an easy way for you show information inside cards that have a consistent look across the platform. These cards have a default elevation above their containing view group, so the system draws shadows below them. Cards provide an easy way to contain a group of views while providing a consistent style for the container.



2) Fixing the sleep pattern?

4) CardView and RecylerView Dependencies for Androidx:(10)


 implementation "androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0"
    // For control over item selection of both touch and mouse driven selection
    implementation "androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview-selection:1.1.0-rc01"
    //noinspection GradleCompatible
    implementation "androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0"



5) Recyler View not showing up in the RealPhone:


This is because we haven't created a contact, but only created a Database according to the code.

The point is there is no issue on the side of service provider or even the WIFI router , the reality is Linux machine is itself sometimes due to improper network settings , so you may have to solve it by getting the solution online from various online platoforms, sometimes the rebooting of router solves the problem or sometimes it is solved by some online methods. The bottom line is that you should not focus on that rather solve it by any means use the OPEN source nature of Linux i.e. Ubuntu , and focus on the positive side always and keep learning and keep pushing your limits.

2) What's the right way to represent phone numbers?

Use String. Aside from anything else, you won't be able to store leading zeroes if you use integers. You definitely shouldn't use int (too small) float or double (too much risk of data loss - see below); long or BigInteger could be appropriate (aside from the leading zeroes problem), but frankly I'd go with String. That way you can also store whatever dashes or spaces the user has entered to make it easier to remember the number, if you want to.

Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.


b) My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Data Science and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge.This course will help me in defining Data Science,understanding how Python could potentially impact our business and industry,to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Data Science,explain Data Science to clients, friends,joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak.Identifying which aspects of Data Science seem most important and relevant to us,Walking away with a strong foundation in where Data Science is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Data Science course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.


c) I don’t have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.

1) Solving the Problem of Unable to display downloaded image from Firebase and displaying it in Recyler view:

a) Downloading Images with FirebaseUI:

FirebaseUI provides simple, customizable, and production-ready native mobile bindings to eliminate boilerplate code and promote Google best practices. Using FirebaseUI you can quickly and easily download, cache, and display images from Cloud Storage using our integration with Glide.

First, add FirebaseUI to your app/build.gradle:

dependencies {
    // FirebaseUI Storage only
    implementation 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-storage:6.2.0'
}



// Reference to an image file in Cloud Storage
StorageReference storageReference = FirebaseStorage.getInstance().getReference();

// ImageView in your Activity
ImageView imageView = findViewById(R.id.imageView);

// Download directly from StorageReference using Glide
// (See MyAppGlideModule for Loader registration)
Glide.with(this /* context */)
        .load(storageReference)
        .into(imageView);





2) Problem solved :


The point was that Picasso was doing its work correctly the downloadURL that we were getting was not correct url:

Problem: Not able to get image on PostList Activity:

Solution: As getDownloadURL is depricated now:( To get any solution regarding deprication look for QNA in the course itself)

Task result = taskSnapshot.getMetadata().getReference().getDownloadUrl();
result.addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener() {
@Override
public void onSuccess(Uri uri) {
String link = uri.toString();
}
});

6) Gravity in Android:

 :android:gravity is used to specify how to place the content of the object within the object itself. In another word, android:gravity is used to specify the gravity of the content of the view. android:layout_gravity is an attribution the child can supply to its parent, to specify the gravity the view within its parents.

and replace <version> with the latest version from either Google's Maven Repository or MVN Repository



Solution:



I had similar problem, replace the TextInputLayout design pattern with below resolved for me:

2) Mip-map vs Drawabale folder:

It's best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from the device's current density. The reason they use a different density is that some launchers actually display the icons larger than they were intended.

In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.[1] John Holland introduced genetic algorithms in 1960 based on the concept of Darwin’s theory of evolution; his student David E. Goldberg further extended GA in 1989.

2) Making Button transparent:

35

use #0000 (only four zeros otherwise it will be considered as black) this is the color code for transparent. You can use it directly but I recommend you to define a color in color.xml so you can enjoy re-usefullness of the code



3) Complete SOS activities:




4) Automatic scrolling of Recyler view:(How do I create a circular (endless) RecyclerView?)



a) implement it in this way, after setting recyclerview to adapter

final int duration = 10;
final int pixelsToMove = 263;
final Handler mHandler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

final Runnable SCROLLING_RUNNABLE = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            recyclerView.smoothScrollBy(pixelsToMove, 0);
            mHandler.postDelayed(this, duration);
        }
    };

recyclerView.addOnScrollListener(new RecyclerView.OnScrollListener() {
        @Override
        public void onScrolled(RecyclerView recyclerView, int dx, int dy) {
            super.onScrolled(recyclerView, dx, dy);
            int lastItem = horizontalLayoutManager.findLastCompletelyVisibleItemPosition();
            if (lastItem == horizontalLayoutManager.getItemCount() - 1) {
                mHandler.removeCallbacks(SCROLLING_RUNNABLE);
                Handler postHandler = new Handler();
                postHandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        quickTips.setAdapter(null);
                        quickTips.setAdapter(adapter);
                        mHandler.postDelayed(SCROLLING_RUNNABLE, 2000);
                    }
                }, 2000);
            }
        }
    });
    mHandler.postDelayed(SCROLLING_RUNNABLE, 2000);



b)  On updating recyler view :

recyclerView.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Call smooth scroll  
        recyclerView.smoothScrollToPosition(adapter.getItemCount() - 1);                                 
    }
});

Harry potter Invisible Cloak ( + code)

The logic is very simple. We are extracting each frame of the video, with the help of segmentation. we separate the background and foreground of the image. We replace the foreground of a particular color with the background which gives the illusion of getting disappeared. I have taken red colored cloth for getting disappeared, you can use any color of your choice.

Our workflow of this project will be:

1. Importing needed libraries and generate the output video
2. Recording and caching the background for each frame.
3. detecting the red portion in each frame
4. Replacing the red portion with a mask image in each frame
5. Producing the surprising output

3) Drum Play through the OpenCv:

🥁TURN ON AUDIO🔊
Playing the Drums🎶 are real fun. Well, I got to know this only after playing those at my friend's place. A few days back a sudden desire of playing the drums struck me. Unable to resist the sudden craving, I decided to make a simple-virtual one for myself using OpenCV.
Masking the Red and Blue colour, I made the 2 sticks using pen-caps. Contouring the cap positions along with combining a total of 4 drums and spending hours selecting proper .wav audios for each I finally got the entire thing ready.
This was something really fun to work on. Keeping the code short and simple made it work quite well, like always. It was a perfect stress buster.

Some Interesting findings:


1) Method Overloading VS Method overiding:

Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class.


2) Exploratory Data Analysis:

In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

3) What is Libarry in Python?

A Python library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to include in your programs/ projects. Compared to languages like C++ or C, a Python libraries do not pertain to any specific context in Python. Here, a 'library' loosely describes a collection of core modules.



4) Tuples in Python:

A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

2) Mode in statistics:

The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.


3) Twin Paradox:

In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more.

MPORTANT NOTICE!!!!
When working with the Quiz dataset
To answer some questions, you will need to normalize the dataset using the MinMaxScaler after removing the following columns: [“date”, “lights”]. The target variable is “Appliances”. Use a 70-30 train-test set split with a random state of 42 (for reproducibility). Run a multiple linear regression using the training set and evaluate your model on the test set.

1) Numpy,Scipy, correlation with Python:

https://realpython.com/numpy-scipy-pandas-correlation-python/



2) Some observations about Dataset:

so far the following are some of my observation from my EDA on the Exam dataset
Date is also of no use as it has 100% uniqueness
T9 is the most correlation with other fields T3, T5 and T7
The random datas inputed also have high correlation with each other and have high unique values
Temperature columns - Temperature inside the house varies between 14.89 Deg & 29.85 Deg , temperatire outside (T6) varies between -6.06 Deg to 28.29 Deg . The reason for this variation is sensors are kept outside the house
Humidiy columns - Humidity inside house varies is between 20.60% to 63.36% with exception of RH_5 (Bathroom) and RH_6 (Outside house) which varies between 29.82% to 96.32% and 1% to 99.9% respectively.
Appliances - 75% of Appliance consumption is less than 100 Wh . With the maximum consumption of 1080 Wh , there will be outliers in this column and there are small number of cases where consumption is very high
its safe to say RH_6, RH_out, Visibility and windspeed have irregular distribution.
Light has not effect on our dataset has it has 15252(77.3%) zeros



3) Instructions for Dataset:

Seems some people are having issues with the instructions,
Let me break it down.
1. You are to drop the light and date columns.
2. You are to normalize the data using a min-max scaler
3. Use a train test split of 70 % train and 30% test, what this means is that your test size parameter in the train test split will be 0.3.
This instruction applies to all question involving the dataset.

10 Commandments of Data Science by Dr. Angshu

1. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

2. Data will never be clean or easily available. Data gathering and cleaning will take 80% of your time and efforts.

3. Don’t underestimate the power of Excel and SQL - they are still two of the most useful tools for data analysis.

4. Simple models such as Linear or Logistics Regression will be good enough for the majority of the problems. You don’t need neural networks to solve every problem.

5. Textbook solutions may not work for most of the practical problems. You will need to try new approaches and innovate as required.

6. Nobody can remember everything. On the job, you can always use Google, Stack Overflow etc.

7. Learn Data Visualisation and develop the ability to explain your key insights in simple terms - such skills will be very useful with non-technical and business stakeholders.

8. Learn PowerPoint and storytelling - people may not appreciate your great work if you can’t convince them with your story.

9. Data Science is evolving rapidly. Please learn continuously, else you may become obsolete soon.

10. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

3) Data Science Myths:

TOP 10 Myths of Data Science

1. Data Science is all about tools and technologies

2. You need a certificate or degree to become a Data Scientist

3. Only engineering graduates can become Data Scientists

4. Only statisticians can become Data Scientists

5. You need to learn difficult mathematics to become a Data Scientist

6. Paid offline Data Science courses are better than free online ones

7. Complex models are always better than simple ones

8. Communication and storytelling are not important in Data Science

9. Domain knowledge is not important for Data Science

10. Data Science is all about tools and technologies

Don’t believe in any of these myths.

Data Science is all about solving a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way. Tools and technologies are secondary.

Your skills and experiences matter the most. Learn as much as you can - there are enough free online courses.


Practising whatever you learn is very important. For example, if you’re learning Python, install Python and Anaconda, and practise whatever you learn.

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, apply your skills on real-life data and projects. Participate in contests and hackathons.

Keep learning. Keep working hard. Keep growing.

Your time will come!

The curiosity of exploring more in the Data Science field is pushing my boundaries further and further.
Made my hand dirty with PyCaret + Titanic Kaggle problem.

PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines.
Yeah, Implementing ML solution is pretty simple nowadays.

With one line (actually two words) of code, we can compare 18 models under six different metrics.

Kindly review and share your feedback if any.

Thanks to the Co-learning lounge and Yogesh Kothiya for motivating me.

Also thanks to Moez Ali for creating such a wonderful library

3) Stage D purpose:

Hey guys. We have been accepted into Stage D and I went through it quickly. These are some things to note;
1. It would run for 21 days
2. We would be making use of Keras and Tensor flow for deep learning projects
3. The quiz has two sections, the first section is like what we have been doing(Multiple choice questions), the second section is relatively new, we are expected to work on a Kaggle project where we will have to share our leaderboard position screenshots after we are done. So Hamoye advised us to begin early:sunglasses:
Goodluck everyone. Happy learning too:grin: :smile:



4) Keras :

Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.


5) Tensorflow:

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

2) Advice:


1) Try to be consistent in anything you do. Make sure you discipline yourself to keep to your plans.
2) Reduce noise and don't get carried away by buzzwords, you will do yourself more harm than good.
3) Don't get carried away by successful people in your career path, remind yourself that they were once at your level, your time will come just make sure you are prepared before then.
4) Be determined, go for what you want with full force
5) There is no shame in using google/stack-overflow. Research is a key ingredient in getting results.
6) Finally, rest, take breaks, have fun, your health is very important.

(10/09/2020)


1) Stage D Plan :


Hi guys...just resuming with stage D.
I see we are having a hard time downloading the dataset especially when we don't wanna consume much MB.
You can do this project using Kaggle notebooks with almost zero cost of MB, in fact that was what Hamoye told us to do in the quiz instructions.
Here are the steps:
1. Login to Kaggle
2. click on create new notebook
3. Select python and click create
4. click on add data
5. click on search by URL
6. copy the URL Mr. Wale sent and paste it
7. click on the data that appears (planet_data)
8. click add.
Your Kaggle notebook is ready.
The dataset are stored in the /Kaggle/input/ directory.
E.g. to load in the train class data...
train_classes = pd.read_csv('/Kaggle/input/planets-dataset/planet/planet/train_classes.csv')
To see the folders,
!ls /Kaggle/input/
Most ML libraries are pre installed in Kaggle notebooks.






(11/09/2020)


1) Stage D Guidance:

@Emmanuel Albert, there is no extensive explanation you need to start out, just start with the Hamoye lessons and the codes. You may probably experience some issues with the codes which is why I put together a notebook for that and further explained the codes.https://github.com/Johnne32/Hamoye-Stage-D-work/blob/master/Hamoye_Stage_D.ipynb
You have to be quick with this as we are also expected to work on a Kaggle dataset. For more info about that, check previous posts and threads,a lot of instructions and suggestions have been given already.

Stage D (100/100)!

#Course:
Neural Networks, Image Recognition and Object Detection - The Amazon Deforestation from Space.

This stage of the Internship was all about Neural Network and its application.
We worked on two two different open source datasets i.e the #MNIST and #Amazon_Deforestation_from_Space.

Key Note from the lesson include;
1. Intro to Keras and Tensorflow with Python
2. worked on Single/Multilayer Perceptron for binary classification where #Activation_functions and other #Hyperparameters like hidden layers, dropouts, etc were introduced to our model
3. Applied Regularization and Optimization algorithms to deal with #Overfitting

We also participated in the #Amazon_Kaggle_Competition were we submitted our #F_beta #Scores to be placed in the #leaderboard, I managed to have a #0.9098 score which was quite good as an Intermediate, and also quizzed on the lesson so far where I got 100/100.

3) CCL:

A Creative Commons license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work". A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created




4) AI :

AI refers to the entire collection of technologies for making computers more intelligent. It encompasses knowledge representation, automated reasoning (both logical and probabilistic), search, planning, scheduling, language understanding, computer vision, hearing (including speech recognition but also audio scene analysis), and of course learning. So machine learning is one component of AI. Like search and reasoning, machine learning is a core technology that helps us build better natural language processing, computer vision, robotic grasping, and so on.


5) ML:

One trend in machine learning, especially in deep neural networks, is known as “end-to-end learning”. In this approach, the entire intelligent system is capable of learning end-to-end through interaction with the world (including feedback from the user). One way to achieve this is through differentiable programming, where every component of the system is (at least approximately) differentiable. In this view, learning should pervade the entire system. An opposing view is that the end-to-end approach risks destroying system modularity, which makes testing and run-time verification more difficult. According to this view, machine learning can be used to construct and maintain individual components, but learning should occur locally and maintain modularity.

1) CTL Interview:

Growth potential is the most important thing to me in any role I accept. I look for good growth potential in terms of my own role within the company and especially in terms of the company’s overall growth. I’d love to work for a company that is innovative and always looking for new opportunities to expand. Secondly, I look for companies who have a positive and adaptive culture. And finally a healthy level of  respect and trust. A positive workplace will create high levels of respect and trust amongst its employees. It is important to me that my coworkers can respect and trust me just as I can trust my coworkers.


My Father is in private service.

I have strong Computer Science and Data Science skills, Good presentation skills, Leadership skills.


I am pretty focused on the fact that I am going to work on my weaknesses , that I may have.

University Cricket Team captain, Occasional  singer and a Good orater.

I see myself as a Higher official  in the CTL and work.

Got 6 months Internship in Hamoye AI Labs,USA.

Professionalism is the conduct, behavior, and attitude of someone in a work or business environment. Professionalism leads to workplace success, a strong professional reputation, and a high level of work ethic and excellence. 

I am passionate about my work.
I am ambitious and driven.
I am highly organized.
I'm a people-person.
I'm a natural leader.
I am results-oriented.
I am an excellent communicator.

All these qualities I have exhibited during my Internship in Freecharge Payments Ltd and at Hamoye AI Labs.




1.A public limited company is a company listed on a recognized stock exchange and the stocks are traded publicly. On the other hand, a private limited company is neither listed on the stock exchange nor are they traded. It is privately held by its members only.
2.The minimum number of members required to start a public company is seven. As against this, the private limited can be started with a minimum of two members.
3.There is a greater regulatory burden on a public limited company. This is because a great amount of information has to be made available to the public who are shareholders or prospective shareholders. A lot of money has to be invested in order to prepare reports and disclosures that match with the regulations provided by SEBI.

4) kernel Trick:

In essence, what the kernel trick does for us is to offer a more efficient and less expensive way to transform data into higher dimensions. With that saying, the application of the kernel trick is not limited to the SVM algorithm.


5) data Modelling:

A data model describes information in a systematic way that allows it to be stored and retrieved efficiently in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), such as SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle. The model can be thought of as a way of translating the logic of accurately describing things in the real-world and the relationships between them into rules that can be followed and enforced by computer code.

1) 10 Commandments of Data Science in 2021:


1. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

2. Data will never be clean or easily available. Data gathering and cleaning will take 80% of your time and efforts.

3. Don’t underestimate the power of Excel and SQL - they are still two of the most useful tools for data analysis.

4. Simple models such as Linear or Logistic Regression will be good enough for many problems. You don’t need neural networks to solve every problem.

5. Textbook solutions may not work for most of the practical problems. You will need to try new approaches and innovate as required.

6. Nobody can remember everything. On the job, you can always use Google, Stack Overflow etc.

7. Learn Data Visualisation and develop the ability to explain your key insights in simple terms - such skills will be very useful with non-technical and business stakeholders.

8. Learn PowerPoint and storytelling - people may not appreciate your great work if you can’t convince them with your story.

9. Data Science is evolving rapidly. Please learn continuously, else you may become obsolete soon.

10. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

1) Data Science is like cooking:

Data Science Head - Sony | Forbes Technology Council | Prof - IIT/IIM/XLRI | Ex - Disney/Target/Grab | 160k+ Followers
2h • 2 hours ago
Data Science Is Like Cooking - 6 Reasons Why

1. Without good ingredients, you can’t cook a good dish. Similarly, without relevant and quality data you can’t do useful Data Science.

2. Cooking is both a science and an art. Data Science is also a science and an art. For both, you need certain tools and skills but you also need creativity and intuition.

3. For cooking, you spend the maximum time in gathering, cleaning and preparing the ingredients. Similarly, in Data Science, you spend the maximum time in gathering, cleaning, and preparing the data.

4. You can cook something by following a video or blog. But, you can’t become a great cook overnight. Similarly, you can do some data analysis or modelling by copying code but that won’t make you a great Data Scientist.

5. Just doing a course or certificate won’t make you a great Chef. Similarly, just doing a course or certificate won’t make you a great Data Scientist. It takes years of dedication, efforts and practise.

6. Everyone can cook something but not every cook is equally valued. World class chefs are few but they are greatly valued. Similarly, everyone can do some data analysis but not every data analyst is equal. World class Data Scientists are few but they are greatly valued.

4 Key Things to Learn for Data Science

1. Theory:
Use Coursera and EdX for theory, concepts and applications of probability, statistics, linear algebra, calculus and machine learning.

2. Data Visualisation:
Tableau and PowerBI are easy to use tools with GUI facility for data visualisation and business intelligence. Matplotlib in Python and ggplot in R are good packages for visualisation.

3. Programming:
Python and R are great free tools that you can download from the internet. RStudio for R and Anaconda for Python are two good tools to write and test codes. You can use Datacamp for learning and hands on practise of Python and R. Then practise machine learning algorithms using Python or R.

4. Big Data:
For Big Data, AWS or Azure can be used for storage and Spark can be used for processing. You need to pull the data from the database, process or filter the data and bring it to usable format. For getting and processing data SQL is a very good tool. You can use the dplyr package in R or pandas in Python for data processing tasks.

2. Keep on Revising Stuff periodically.
3. Don't try to master anything in the first go. It will come gradually with revision.
4. Keep exploring the mathematics under the hood of the algorithms.
5. Try to use as much reusable stuff (code and libraries) as possible as it is not about showing our genius but it is about solving our customer's business problems efficiently.
6. Keep honing your coding skills slowly and steadily.
7. Keep relentless patience as it will take a lot of time.
